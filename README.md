# Go8 a simple Chip-8 emulator written in golang   
----------

This emulator is a little project of mine I made to learn more about low level concepts of computers (yes I know this machine is technically a VM but still)

## Dependencies   
   
The only library this application depends on is the RayLibGo bindings so be sure you have raylib installed

## TODO
   
Optimize in places. I feel like this program could 100% be faster   
   
Implement Sound. It really won't be that hard to do but I'm getting bored of this project   
   
Maybe add a GUI interface for loading ROMS on the fly. Would be nice so you don't have to open a terminal to open ROMS
