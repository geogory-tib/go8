Gotext is a simple text editor I wrote in go.
I is to enter enter mode (only one line can be edited at a time). To add a new line to the file press enter after entering edit mode 
CTRL-W to save 
and PDGUP AND PDGDOWN to scroll by page.
Press G while not in insert mode to search for a line in the file
